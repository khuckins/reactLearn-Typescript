# react.dev/learn Tic-Tac-Typescript Companion Guide

This project serves as a companion guide to the official [react.dev/learn Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), allowing you to follow along both the official guide, as well as this one, to begin learning how to implement Typescript with React. 

## Getting Started
Navigate to [guide.md](https://github.com/khuckins/reactLearn-Typescript/blob/main/guide.md), and follow along. It will guide you through how to set up the project, when to switch to the official react.dev/learn guide, what changes to make, and why they're needed. If you get lost, at any time you may compare your work with `CompleteSrc\App.tsx`.
